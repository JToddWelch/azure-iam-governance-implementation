# Azure Entra ID Identity & Access Management (IAM) Implementation  
## IT Project Manager Portfolio Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end delivery of an Azure Entra ID Identity & Access Management (IAM) implementation using a hybrid Agile approach.

The initiative was designed to address over-privileged access, lack of governance, and audit risk by implementing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model aligned to Zero Trust security principles.

- Enforce least-privilege access using RBAC  
- Implement Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
